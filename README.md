# Robot Blackjack

A barebones prototype for a topdown 2D RPG Blackjack game (Sounds odd but I'll make it work).
Currently on hold due to school and work, but expect to see it rocket off in mid-November (when my computer science class starts).

Currently features:
* A start screen with a pretty cool cat

* WASD controlled animated robot

* Full (slightly janky) player collision

* A seperate rooms.py program that holds the roomtype data as well, as functioning as a quick way to draw room collision boxes when run

* A room navigation system, allowing the player to enter and leave different rooms

* A fully interchangeable map matrix that will allow for easy map layout, as well as easy testing of future rooms
